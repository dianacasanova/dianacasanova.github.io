    <p> <strong> Research Interests:</strong> I am interested in understanding how historically marginalized people are motivated and empowered, individually and collectively, to change institutions so that they better serve and address their needs. And then to better understand what impact, if any, they wield on the institution.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I see this public institution of education mediating the change process in a couple of ways:</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The first being rooted in that oft-cited platitude that education is the key to a “better life.” For all intents and purposes, I do think that public schooling is a powerful and accessible policy lever for transforming life outcomes vis-a-vis access to opportunities impacting social mobility.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I also see that public education is democracy on a miniature scale. It&#39;s a training ground where community and parent advocates cut their teeth in pursuit of more enfranchised lives. Speaking specifically to CA’s finance reform, where urban school districts get more money, have more flexibility in spending this money, and community engagement is mandatory—the setting is ripe to observe and generate questions about the manner in which families and communities build power, as well as their role in affecting institutional change.
